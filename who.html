              I'm a full stack web developer, but if you made it here you probably know that already.
              What you don't know is that I'm passionate about development in a way that scares my friends.
              I'm always looking for a new challenge, and crave creative outlets.
            </p>

            <p>
              As well as my dedication to my chosen career, I have a background in Philosophy and Classics, gaining
              a B.A. from the University of Toronto in those fields.  My education taught me how to think analytically
              and critically in a way that often gives me unique insight and perspective when it comes to problem solving.
              While earning my degree and for some time after, I worked in restaurants, pushing the threshold of a human's
              ability to multitask, and learning how to apply my deep philosophical knowledge on the general public.  Nobody knows
              conflict resolution like a bartender.
            </p>

            <p>
              So, why web development then?  I felt that I had learned everything that I wanted to learn from hospitality, and
              needed both a creative and intellectual challenge.  Working with the web means constantly needing to be on the cutting
              edge of new technologies, constant new tests of my skills, and a need to be always adaptive.  It's a demanding field
              that ties in a number of my personal interests.  In order to break into the industry, I took a code bootcamp course at Bitmaker,
              which allowed me to scale up my skills quickly, and taught me how to find the resources to continue my education on my own.  Since then
              I've been attending meetups, going through online courses, and working both full time and contract work for companies, as well as on my own
              personal projects.  I'm immensely excited to continue along this path, and see what the web ecosystem looks like as I gain expertise.
